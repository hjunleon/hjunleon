Hi, I'm [Jun Leong](https://extremelysunnyyk.github.io/), a passionate software engineer from Singapore. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build. My interests are pretty broad, so you'll won't be bored with what you see! ðŸ˜„

I am also an open-source enthusiast as I love how the culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing.
